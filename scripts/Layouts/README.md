# Layouts
My custom layout for my Rotorflight main-screen for Ethos courtesy the new Lua Layouts feature in 1.5.9+<br>
3 Column: 3-2-2 Layout<br>
Currently compatible with X20 and X18, other radios not added yet

Note the widgets themselves are not included/preconfigured, this Lua only creates the layout!  Widgets shown above are all Value widgets, plus my own BattSelector and Rob Thomson's RF2Gov widget.
